                <ul>
                    <li>Assignments and Tests
                        <p>There will two mid-semester exams, a final, and probably 9 homework 
                            assignments. Exams are given on Sakai and Gradescope, and student grades are 
                            recorded on Sakai. The mid-semester exams for both sections will be on 
                            Monday, September 27 and Wednesday, November 3. The final exam date for section 
                            001 will be Friday, December 10 at noon. The final exam date for section 002 
                            will be Friday, December 3 at 4:00 PM. Exams are in class and are closed 
                            book and closed notes, but if the exams are given remotely, the conditions 
                            may be different. All quizzes together count zero percent of the grade. Quizzes 
                            are also given on Sakai. Other than this, the grading algorithm will probably 
                            be 36 percent for the final exam, 26 percent for the second mid semester exam, 
                            26 percent for the second mid semester exam, and 12 percent for homework. 
                            There may also be a few extra credit challenge problems.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>Homework
                        <p>Homework will be submitted on Gradescope. You may work on the homework in groups 
                            of at most four persons. Please use Gradescope&rsquo;s group facility if you 
                        do this. Homework is important for the grade and for your understanding of the 
                        material.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>Class Participation
                        <p>Class participation and behavior in class can affect your grade, if the class 
                            is not huge. Also, there are a few guidelines for behavior. If you have to leave 
                        class for a good reason, you don&rsquo;t need to wait until my back is turned. 
                        If you need to yawn, do it quietly. Try to enjoy class. Think of it as a course 
                        you chose, even if it is now a required course. It may help.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>Grade distribution
                        <p>In my classes most of the students typically get a C or better, but I do not 
                            grade on a curve. Typically 90-100 percent is the A range, 80-90 is B range, 
                        and so on, with a little more generosity for C and D. Plus and minus grades are 
                        near the boundaries. If there are many high grades then the cutoff between A 
                        and A- may be raised to as high as 95 percent. There are also typically extra credit 
                        problems on exams so it is possible to have well over 100 percent. This 
                        course requires some aptitude in theory. If you are weak in theory (i.e, math), 
                        do not be upset if you do not get an A or a B. In the fall of 2002 people did 
                        unusually well and there were 19 A&rsquo;s, 3 H&rsquo;s, 9 B&rsquo;s, and 
                        6 C&rsquo;s. In the spring of 2002 there were 16 A&rsquo;s, 23 B&rsquo;s, 16 C&rsquo;s, 
                        and one D, not counting plusses and minuses and not counting graduate students, 
                        most of whom got H&rsquo;s. The 16 C&rsquo;s included one C-. Students who do 
                        not come to class often, tend to get lower grades unless they have exceptional 
                        ability in abstract thinking. IF the exams are given remotely and are open book 
                        and open notes, there tend to be more A&rsquo;s.</p>
